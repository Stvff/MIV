When another window is above MIV, MIV still reads the mouse position from that window.
When an older window is closed above MIV, MIV crashes?? OBS has a similar effect.

While scrolling through a directory, MIV attempts to open files it doesn't/shouldn't know instead of skipping them like it should.

Pressing 'hist' when there's no file causes a crash.

Registration file is actually redundant, since we can read entire directories now.

Errors don't take away control from the rest of the screen, which means you can layer errors
That might be ok, but then an error counter with 'n remaining errors' would be very useful regardless

Fit buttons should be unpressable and highlighted instead of pressable and unhighlighted when there's no images.
