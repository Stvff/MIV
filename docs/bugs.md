When another window is above MIV, MIV still reads the mouse position from that window.
When an older window is closed above MIV, MIV crashes?? OBS has a similar effect.

While scrolling through a directory, MIV attempts to open files it doesn't/shouldn't know instead of skipping them like it should.
