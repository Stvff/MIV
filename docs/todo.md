## Bugs to fix
- There is a potential read out of bounds error when a PPM file is too short and ends in whitespace.
- When another window is above MIV, MIV still reads the mouse position from that window.
- Slider drops input when you move out of it too fast.
- When falling back on a different plugin, there should be a warning generated.
- `log`s from libraries etc sometimes have a trailing newline, or leading tabs. These should ideally be truncated.
